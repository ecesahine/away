        <h2 class="story-title">“‘Knowledge is the best tool for self-development’: A story on combining passion with studies”</h2>
        <p class="story-writer">Can Eminoğlu | 24 December 2021</p>
        <blockquote class="story-quota">“I was really excited to join the Google training, as it finally provided me with the formal and more theoretical knowledge on digital marketing that I was lacking.”</blockquote>
        <h3 class="story-subtitle"><span>Story #1</span> HAYSAM</h3>
        <p class="story-article">Haysam is a twenty-four-year-old Syrian who lives with his brother in Turkey. He is currently a freshman at Ankara University, where he is studying health sciences. In spring 2021, he joined the Google Maharat min Programme, a new training initiative on digital marketing jointly launched by UNHCR and Google.
          Expanding his horizons and thinking outside the box has always been Haysam’s way of life. “Knowledge is the best tool for self-development. For this reason, I am always keen to find new ways of extending the boundaries of what I know,” notes Haysam. This motivation has led him to join the Google digital skills training course, implemented by UNHCR’s NGO partner Habitat across fourteen cities in Turkey. “A friend of mine informed me about the digital marketing course,” he says. “I submitted my application and shortly after, I got accepted.”
          Since his childhood, Haysam has tried to do things differently. When the time had come to choose his career path after high school, he noticed that most of his friends and members in his community were working in a specific sector, such as tailoring. This is when Haysam decided to choose a different path than his peers, enrolling at Damascus University to study pharmaceutical science.
          After studying for two years, Haysam had to abandon his studies when the conflict broke out and he fled to Turkey. In his new life in Turkey, he never gave up on his dream of continuing his academic studies. “I tried every possible way to get back to university and studied hard to do well in the university entrance exams,” he says. “My hard work paid off and this year, I have been accepted to the Faculty of Health Science at Ankara University. I cannot describe how happy I am now.”
          Online marketing is one of Haysam’s main passions. Some years ago, he started working for companies specialized in digital marketing and programming, where he quickly developed his practical skills in the sector. He liked his experience so much so that he wanted to become a professional in digital marketing in parallel with his academic studies. “At the time, I learnt all the online tools by myself, without any formal training. Therefore, I was really excited to join the Google training, as it finally provided me with the formal and more theoretical knowledge on digital marketing that I was lacking,” he mentions. “In addition to this, I had the chance to learn how to develop and incorporate a digital marketing strategy in a prospect business plan.”
          Because of the COVID-19 situation in Turkey, the Google training was provided remotely. For Haysam, this was not a particular challenge, as the virtual classes were nonetheless rich in content and dynamic. “The other participants and I actively engaged in the discussions, also thanks to the support of the trainer who provided follow-up sessions with us,” Haysam explains. The fruitful discussions also supported him on how to combine marketing with health sciences. “In the future,” he adds,  “I can follow a career path where  I can work on digital marketing in a health-related sector.”
          As an important step of the initiative, UNHCR’s partner Habitat organized a virtual job fair for all training attendees in December. This provided Haysam and the other participants an opportunity to meet with possible prospect employers, learn about the available employment opportunities at different companies as well as exchange views on individual career plans.
          The training and the job fair are part of UNHCR’s overall approach to provide livelihood opportunities to persons who have been forced to flee their homes and have found refuge in Turkey. In the same spirit, the Google-funded initiative will provide Haysam and the other participants the opportunity to strengthen their capacity to lead more independent and resilient lives.</p>

        <p class="story-writer">Save the Children</p>
        <blockquote class="story-quota">"I am tired of waiting here all day. We just stand in the rain but I will tell you something: after everything we have been through, a bit of rain can’t hurt me."</blockquote>
        <h3 class="story-subtitle"><span>Story #2</span> YASER</h3>
        <p class="story-article">For two long years, violence has kept Yaser’s* five children, Ali*, 15, Achmed*, 14, Hala*, 10, Sedra*, 7 and Aya*, 3, from living a normal life. They haven’t been able to go to school or play outside – the sniper and missile attacks made it too risky. Instead, they learned what type of weapon was being used just by the sound it made.
          "Being scared was a permanent state of mind. I was always scared," said Achmed. "When I went to bed, I always wondered if I would wake up the next morning." Eventually the violence became too much for Yaser and his wife, and they made the decision to uproot their family from their home in Syria in search of a better life in Germany. They were only able to make their long and difficult journey from sunset to sunrise so they would not be spotted. Young Hala lost her glasses during their trek. "Everything is already strange, but now it is also blurry," she said. "It is very scary not to be able to see clearly."
          They walked for days until they reached the boat that would carry them to Germany. The water was rough and the children were scared, but the family eventually made it. Now they must wait to register for asylum, a process that takes up to two weeks. During those two weeks the family must wait outside the registration center every day for their number to be called. There are no facilities or shelter from the rain.
          "I am tired of waiting here all day. We just stand in the rain," said Achmed. "But I will tell you something: after everything we have been through, a bit of rain can’t hurt me."</p>

        <h3 class="story-subtitle"><span>Story #3</span> RABIA & MOHAMMED</h3>
        <p class="story-article">Looking back, Rabia* and Mohamed* never thought the war in Syria would reach their village. They lived a quiet life with their young son, away from the mayhem going on in the cities. Rabia was expecting their second child, a daughter, when the war showed up at their doorstep.
          "Before the war in Syria our lives were fine. But when the war came, everything became very difficult. All of the systems and organizations in the town fell to the extremists. All the schools changed and all the cities started to fall apart," Rabia said. "We didn't know who was fighting whom anymore. We had to leave because of our children. We had no other option."
          When their son Abdul* was 2, and their daughter Yasmin* was a 4-month old infant – they made the difficult decision to leave. First, they fled to Turkey, then continued on to Greece.
          "The first time we tried to get a boat to Greece, a person drowned so we had to turn back," Rabia said. "When we got back to Turkey, we were arrested and put in jail."
          Eventually, they were released and set out for Greece in an overcrowded boat.
          "It took us eight hours to get to Greece. It was extremely cold. Everything was wet. The babies were ill. We had life jackets but everything was so wet that we were sinking. We threw our bags off the boat to stop it from sinking more."
          Soaking wet, afraid, without any possessions, but grateful to be alive, they arrived in Greece. From there, they planned to take the train to Croatia and then make their way to Germany, where they can start over.
          "We need our children to have a life. The best thing for our children is peace. They need to live."
