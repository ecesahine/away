          <p class="story-writer">Can Eminoğlu | 24 December 2021</p>
        <p class="story-article">Haysam is a twenty-four-year-old Syrian who lives with his brother in Turkey. He is
          currently a freshman at Ankara University, where he is studying health sciences. In spring 2021, he joined the
          Google Maharat min Programme, a new training initiative on digital marketing jointly launched by UNHCR and
          Google.
          Expanding his horizons and thinking outside the box has always been Haysam’s way of life. “Knowledge is the
          best tool for self-development. For this reason, I am always keen to find new ways of extending the boundaries
          of what I know,” notes Haysam. This motivation has led him to join the Google digital skills training course,
          implemented by UNHCR’s NGO partner Habitat across fourteen cities in Turkey. “A friend of mine informed me
          about the digital marketing course,” he says. “I submitted my application and shortly after, I got accepted.”
          Since his childhood, Haysam has tried to do things differently. When the time had come to choose his career
          path after high school, he noticed that most of his friends and members in his community were working in a
          specific sector, such as tailoring. This is when Haysam decided to choose a different path than his peers,
          enrolling at Damascus University to study pharmaceutical science.
          After studying for two years, Haysam had to abandon his studies when the conflict broke out and he fled to
          Turkey. In his new life in Turkey, he never gave up on his dream of continuing his academic studies. “I tried
          every possible way to get back to university and studied hard to do well in the university entrance exams,” he
          says. “My hard work paid off and this year, I have been accepted to the Faculty of Health Science at Ankara
          University. I cannot describe how happy I am now.”
          Online marketing is one of Haysam’s main passions. Some years ago, he started working for companies
          specialized in digital marketing and programming, where he quickly developed his practical skills in the
          sector. He liked his experience so much so that he wanted to become a professional in digital marketing in
          parallel with his academic studies. “At the time, I learnt all the online tools by myself, without any formal
          training. Therefore, I was really excited to join the Google training, as it finally provided me with the
          formal and more theoretical knowledge on digital marketing that I was lacking,” he mentions. “In addition to
          this, I had the chance to learn how to develop and incorporate a digital marketing strategy in a prospect
          business plan.”
          Because of the COVID-19 situation in Turkey, the Google training was provided remotely. For Haysam, this was
          not a particular challenge, as the virtual classes were nonetheless rich in content and dynamic. “The other
          participants and I actively engaged in the discussions, also thanks to the support of the trainer who provided
          follow-up sessions with us,” Haysam explains. The fruitful discussions also supported him on how to combine
          marketing with health sciences. “In the future,” he adds, “I can follow a career path where I can work on
          digital marketing in a health-related sector.”
          As an important step of the initiative, UNHCR’s partner Habitat organized a virtual job fair for all training
          attendees in December. This provided Haysam and the other participants an opportunity to meet with possible
          prospect employers, learn about the available employment opportunities at different companies as well as
          exchange views on individual career plans.
          The training and the job fair are part of UNHCR’s overall approach to provide livelihood opportunities to
          persons who have been forced to flee their homes and have found refuge in Turkey. In the same spirit, the
          Google-funded initiative will provide Haysam and the other participants the opportunity to strengthen their
          capacity to lead more independent and resilient lives.</p>

          will tell you something: after everything we have been through, a bit of rain can’t hurt me."</blockquote>
          <p class="story-writer">Save the Children</p>
        <p class="story-article">For two long years, violence has kept Yaser’s* five children, Ali*, 15, Achmed*, 14,
          Hala*, 10, Sedra*, 7 and Aya*, 3, from living a normal life. They haven’t been able to go to school or play
          outside – the sniper and missile attacks made it too risky. Instead, they learned what type of weapon was
          being used just by the sound it made.
          "Being scared was a permanent state of mind. I was always scared," said Achmed. "When I went to bed, I always
          wondered if I would wake up the next morning." Eventually the violence became too much for Yaser and his wife,
          and they made the decision to uproot their family from their home in Syria in search of a better life in
          Germany. They were only able to make their long and difficult journey from sunset to sunrise so they would not
          be spotted. Young Hala lost her glasses during their trek. "Everything is already strange, but now it is also
          blurry," she said. "It is very scary not to be able to see clearly."
          They walked for days until they reached the boat that would carry them to Germany. The water was rough and the
          children were scared, but the family eventually made it. Now they must wait to register for asylum, a process
          that takes up to two weeks. During those two weeks the family must wait outside the registration center every
          day for their number to be called. There are no facilities or shelter from the rain.
          "I am tired of waiting here all day. We just stand in the rain," said Achmed. "But I will tell you something:
          after everything we have been through, a bit of rain can’t hurt me."</p>

          <p class="story-writer">Save the Children</p>
        <p class="story-article">Looking back, Rabia* and Mohamed* never thought the war in Syria would reach their
          village. They lived a quiet life with their young son, away from the mayhem going on in the cities. Rabia was
          expecting their second child, a daughter, when the war showed up at their doorstep.
          "Before the war in Syria our lives were fine. But when the war came, everything became very difficult. All of
          the systems and organizations in the town fell to the extremists. All the schools changed and all the cities
          started to fall apart," Rabia said. "We didn't know who was fighting whom anymore. We had to leave because of
          our children. We had no other option."
          When their son Abdul* was 2, and their daughter Yasmin* was a 4-month old infant – they made the difficult
          decision to leave. First, they fled to Turkey, then continued on to Greece.
          "The first time we tried to get a boat to Greece, a person drowned so we had to turn back," Rabia said. "When
          we got back to Turkey, we were arrested and put in jail."
          Eventually, they were released and set out for Greece in an overcrowded boat.
          "It took us eight hours to get to Greece. It was extremely cold. Everything was wet. The babies were ill. We
          had life jackets but everything was so wet that we were sinking. We threw our bags off the boat to stop it
          from sinking more."
          Soaking wet, afraid, without any possessions, but grateful to be alive, they arrived in Greece. From there,
          they planned to take the train to Croatia and then make their way to Germany, where they can start over.
          "We need our children to have a life. The best thing for our children is peace. They need to live."

        <h3 class="story-subtitle">MUSTAFA</h3>
        <h2 class="story-title">"Building motivation through physical wellbeing"</h2>
        <blockquote class="story-quota hover-four">“The help came right on time. We felt valued.”</blockquote>
        <p class="story-writer">Can Eminoğlu | 3 December 2021</p>
        <p class="story-article">“Schools are open again,” says Mustafa*, living with his parents and three siblings in
          Şanlıurfa. “I am so happy to be back in the classroom with my friends.” His family is originally from Aleppo
          and came to Turkey in 2014. Mustafa’s mother, Nabila* shares her son’s happiness as she thinks getting back to
          school motivates him, especially after more than two semesters of online education. “Socializing means a lot
          for children,” she says. “It means more for Mustafa as he suffers from chronic asthma and staying at home all
          day affected him negatively.”
          The first years in Turkey were difficult for the family as Mustafa often needed to go to the hospital due to
          his serious medical condition, and the support received from the family’s acquaintances was not enough for
          Mustafa’s full recovery. “Neither our friends nor we in Şanlıurfa knew the hospital procedures. It was a real
          challenge to see a doctor each time,” notes Nabila. “Being unable to speak Turkish was another struggle.” The
          family’s challenges ended once a neighbour informed them about the support of one of the partners of UNHCR,
          AAR Japan. After reaching out to the organisation’s hotline, Mustafa’s family was immediately contacted, and
          they booked an appointment for a detailed assessment. “The help came right on time,” Mustafa’s father, Salem*
          notes. “We felt valued.”
          Shortly after reaching out to UNHCR’s partner, Mustafa’s family reached the available services and started
          receiving treatment. Thanks to this, his medical condition improved significantly in a short period of time.
          “The organisation provided help for getting doctor appointments, translation and obtaining prescriptions. They
          also donated a nebuliser which the doctor had recommended,” explains Nabila. “The device played a key role in
          his recovery. In the past, Mustafa could not leave home due to his breathing problems, but now he feels much
          better. He even started playing football with his friends, which he long dreamed of.”
          In the meantime, Mustafa received treatment for the eye deviation he has had since his early childhood. With
          the support of AAR Japan, his parents were able to follow up Mustafa’s required medical check-ups easily, and
          he has donated a pair of glasses as well. “His reading and writing skills are developing each day thanks to
          his improving eyesight,” Mustafa’s father notes. “This reflected positively on his overall performance at
          school. We are delighted about this.”
          Mustafa told us that the improvement of his condition allowed him to think about what he wants to be in the
          future. “My favourite course is English,” he concludes. “I want to be a teacher and motivate everyone to learn
          this language.”

        <blockquote class="story-quota hover-five">“Do not stop, always look ahead and strive for a better life.”</blockquote>
        <h2 class="story-title">“Life is never linear”</h2>
        <p class="story-writer">Can Eminoğlu | 12 November 2021</p>
        <p class="story-article">When Khaled talks about his family, his face lights up. “I am the father of two young
          daughters. My first daughter is one and a half years old, and the youngest one was born only two months ago,”
          he says. “I am very lucky to have them.”Khaled lives with his wife, their children and his parents in a small
          apartment in Istanbul. To support the family of six, he works as a salesperson in a shop that sells hygiene
          products in his neighbourhood. “In Syria, I went to university, and I also used to work as a tailor,” he
          explains. “Unfortunately, due to my poor eyesight, I cannot carry out this work anymore.” Khaled’s eyes were
          injured when a bomb struck his home during the conflict in Syria. “Because of this terrible incident, I lost
          my only brother. I got injured, and so did my mother,” he says.
          After fleeing to Turkey, Khaled approached UNHCR’s partner ASAM for help. “I received a lot of assistance,” he
          notes. “For example, they helped me receive treatment for my visual impairment, including the glasses I am
          wearing today, which help me see better.” Along the way, Khaled’s family had to overcome a series of
          challenges. When Khaled’s wife was expecting their first child, she experienced complications during the
          pregnancy, which put mother and daughter at serious risk. “Both of them were in a critical condition and
          needed specialized medical help, which we were not able to receive at their current hospital,” Khaled
          explains. With support from UNHCR’s partner, Khaled’s wife and baby were transferred to a hospital that could
          offer them the urgent treatment they needed. “I am very relieved that they could receive the medical care they
          needed,” says Khaled. “Due to the difficult pregnancy and birth, our doctor expressed concerns that our
          daughter might possibly experience some long-term consequences, but so far, she seems to be doing well, and my
          wife has recovered too.” The COVID-19 pandemic also impacted Khaled and his family. At the height of the
          pandemic, most shops had to close and people were required to stay at home during the lockdown periods, which
          affected the family’s livelihood. “This was an additional challenge,” Khaled recalls. “Fortunately, during the
          lockdowns, a member from ASAM came by our door to check on us and our newborn baby and helped with much-needed
          food parcels, baby diapers, and other hygiene products.”
          Khaled also received support for his parents when they joined him in Turkey. “My mother has chronic health
          problems, in addition to the injuries that were inflicted on her by the blast in our home in Syria,” Khaled
          explains. “After we received support to register my parents in Turkey, their psychological and social
          situation improved significantly, and so did the mood in our house.” Although life has thrown many obstacles
          at Khaled and his family, they persevered. “Persons fleeing their country should not think that their lives
          are over, they should not give up,” Khaled stresses with determination. “Look at me: some time ago, my
          family’s situation was fragile: my wife had pregnancy complications, I was affected by my eye injuries, my
          mother suffered from health issues, and we were struck by a pandemic, on top of all of this,” Khaled points
          out. “But we carried on and because of this, our situation gradually got better. Today, I have many things to
          be thankful for. I have two children, I have a job, and my mother’s health is also slowly but steadily
          improving. I am optimistic about the future.” he says. “My message to all other people who may be in a similar
          situation is: Do not stop, always look ahead and strive for a better life. Remember, life is never linear. It
          does not stop, it goes on.”</p>
