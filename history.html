        <h2 class="history-title">Syria Refugee Crisis Explained</h2>
        <p class="history-writer">The UN Refugee Agency | 5 February 2021</p>
        <img class="history-image">
        <h3 class="history-subtitle"><span>Article #1</span>WHAT, WHEN, HOW</h3>
        <p class="history-article">After ten years, Syria remains the world’s largest refugee crisis. More than 6.6
          million Syrians have been forced to flee their country since 2011 and another 6.7 million people remain
          internally displaced. The vast majority – approximately 5.5 million refugees – have found refuge in
          neighboring countries, primarily in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. <b><br>When did the Syrian
            refugee crisis begin?<br></b>The Syrian refugee crisis is the result of a March 2011 violent government
          crackdown on public demonstrations in support of a group of teenagers who were arrested for anti-government
          graffiti in the southern town of Daraa. The arrests sparked public demonstrations throughout Syria which were
          violently suppressed by government security forces.Conflict quickly escalated and the country descended into a
          civil war that forced millions of Syrian families out of their homes. Ten years later, the number of Syrian
          refugees has hardly declined and more than 13 million people still need humanitarian assistance - including 6
          million who are in acute need.
          <br><b>What is happening in Syria’s northwest region – specifically in Idlib – right now?</b><br> Torrential
          rains, strong winds and floods have been lashing the country’s northwest region this winter, destroying tents,
          food supplies and leaving tens of thousands of displaced Syrian families homeless during the coldest months.
          More than 140,000 people have been affected and at least 25,000 tents have been destroyed.
          Outbreaks of violence in Idlib in December 2019 and February 2020 forced an additional one million people to
          flee their homes. The majority – about 80 percent – of those who have fled Idlib and the surrounding areas are
          women and children.<br>
          <b>Where do Syrian refugees live? Do all Syrian refugees live in refugee camps?</b><br>Syrian refugees have
          sought asylum in more than 130 countries, but the vast majority live in neighboring countries within the
          region, such as Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. Turkey alone hosts the largest population - 3.6
          million. Approximately 92 percent of refugees who have fled to neighboring countries live in rural and urban
          settings,
          with only roughly five percent living in refugee camps. However, living outside refugee camps does not
          necessarily mean success or stability. More than 70 percent of Syrian refugees are living in poverty, with
          limited access to basic services, education or job opportunities and few prospects of returning home.<br>
          <b>What are Syrian’s greatest challenges?</b><br>Poverty and unemployment are some of the biggest challenges
          Syrian refugees face, which have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 70 percent of Syrian
          refugees live in poverty and a World Bank - UNHCR report estimates that an additional one million Syrian
          refugees, along with 4.4 million members of their host communities in Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq, were pushed
          into poverty in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. Millions have lost their livelihoods and are
          increasingly unable to meet their basic needs - including accessing clean water, electricity, food, medicine
          and paying rent. The economic downturn has also exposed them to multiple protection risks, such as child
          labor, gender-based violence, early marriage and other forms of exploitation.
          Refugees living in refugee camps or camp-like situations also face an increased risk of COVID-19 infection.
          Overcrowded conditions in refugee camps make it difficult to practice public health measures like frequent
          handwashing and physical distancing.<br>
          <b>How are Syrian children impacted by this crisis?</b><br>Ten years of crisis have had a profound impact on
          Syrian children. They have been exposed to violence and indiscriminate attacks, losing their loved ones, their
          homes, their possessions and everything they once knew. They have grown up knowing nothing but the crisis.
          Today, approximately 45 percent of Syrian refugees in the region are under 18 years old and more than a third
          of them do not have access to education.
          Children’s rights during the crisis are undermined on a daily basis. An increasing number of Syrian children
          have fallen victims of child labor, with cases in Lebanon almost doubling in just one year.

        <h2 class="history-title">War in Syria: Country in ruins after 10 years of fighting and repression</h2>
        <p class="history-writer">Ilaria Sesana | 30 March 2021</p>
        <img class="history-image">
        <h3 class="history-subtitle"><span>Article #2</span> CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES</h3>
        <p class="history-article"><i>Ten years of civil war in Syria have devastated the lives of millions of people
            and continue to drive thousands to flee. The economic crisis cuts off any hope of improvement. While
            refugees abroad no longer want to return to their homes. Here is how this situation came about and what is
            happening today.</i>
          <br>March 2011. While the protests against the regimes inflamed the squares of the main cities of the Middle
          East , on the walls of Daraa, a city south of Damascus, an inscription appeared: " Now it's your turn, doctor
          ". A message, not too veiled, addressed to the dictator Bashar al Assad (graduate in ophthalmology, hence the
          name) a few weeks after the fall of Hosni Moubarak , which took place on 11 February after weeks of protests
          in Cairo, Egypt.<br>
          <b>War in Syria: the causes and the first developments</b><br>In Syria , as had already happened in Egypt,
          Tunisia , Libya , Yemen , dozens of protests were held to demand freedom, dignity and reforms. And the kids
          wrote the slogans of the protests on the walls of the houses.
          The local security chief - Bashar al Assad's cousin - was unwilling to let it go: the children were arrested,
          beaten and tortured . Meanwhile, protests spread throughout the country : on March 15 a large protest took
          place in Damascus, on March 18 the security forces opened fire on the demonstrators in Daraa, killing four
          people. As a detailed article in the Economist weekly reconstructs , at first it was not clear how Bashar al
          Assad would react. There are those who advised him to remove the local police chief and to apologize, promise
          reforms and change. On March 30, on the other hand, Assad gave a fundamental speech for the recent history of
          his country : speaking of conspiracies against Syria, brandishing the images of the videos that show the army
          firing on the crowd as hoaxes, rejecting any request for reform, pointing to them as cover for an unspecified
          foreign conspiracy. “After the talk, the demonstrations grew in number and size each week, usually gathering
          after Friday prayers.
          Thus began a growing cycle of funerals, protests and violence. Over the course of a month , the regime's
          response became more ferocious : first the hit men, then the snipers, then the heavy artillery, ”writes the
          Economist .<br>
          <b>2011-2021, the consequences of the war on Syrian children</b><br>
          10 years have passed since March 15, 2011, the symbolic date indicated as the beginning of the demonstrations
          against the Assad regime which then resulted in a long civil war that caused over 387,000 deaths (of which
          118,000 civilians) and forced 12 million of people to leave their homes : of these, half have fled the country
          to seek refuge abroad, especially in neighboring countries such as Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq . Huge numbers if
          you consider that in 2010 Syria had about 23 million inhabitants.
          As always happens in conflict situations, the youngest are the first victims: at least 12,000 children were
          killed or injured between 2011 and 2020. "A decade of conflict has had a devastating impact on children and
          families in Syria" , Unicef ​​warns : today about 90% of minors in the country are in need of humanitarian
          assistance (20% more than last year) and over half of children under one year of age suffer from stunting due
          to chronic malnutrition. For an entire generation , school is just a distant memory or something they have
          never seen: one in three schools is unusable, because it is damaged or used for military purposes. About 2.4
          million children in Syria
          and another 750,000 small refugees in neighboring countries are out of school. Four out of ten are girls ,
          particularly exposed to the risk of becoming brides while still very young. Also according to the UN fund, the
          number of children showing symptoms of mental suffering has doubled in 2020.<br>
          <b>Syria, the stories of Mustafa, Massa and Farah</b><br>Mustafa, Massa and Farah are three very young people
          who have lived most or all of their lives under the bombs. Mustafa is 9 years old and you have never known
          anything other than war: he was only eight months old when he had to flee Raqqa with his whole family to
          escape the bombing. He found refuge in Iraqi Kudistan, in a refugee camp near Erbil.
          Although he had no visible injuries, Mustafa was manifesting deep suffering: the bombings, the death of his
          little brother and the stampede caused severe trauma that manifested itself in unstoppable crying, isolation,
          refusal of food and nightmares. Massa, on the other hand, was born and raised in Aleppo: she was only 3 years
          old when the conflict began and her life was turned upside down when an explosion caused her a cerebral
          hemorrhage , which in turn generated a
          hemiplegia of the whole. left side of the body. Farah is a 20-year-old mother who has lived half her life in a
          context of economic hardship imposed by the war
          and the sanctions that have caused both her and her child to suffer from moderate acute malnutrition .
          In recent months, the operators of the Italian NGO Terre des Hommes , which had been present in Syria and in
          the region since before the conflict, have been taking care of them.
          <br><b>At what stage is the war in Syria: the economic crisis threatens Assad</b><br>
          The most immediate threat to President Bashar al Assad is not the rebels or even the foreign powers that
          control large areas of the country. "It is rather the crushing economic crisis , which has hindered the
          rebuilding of destroyed cities, impoverished the population and forced a growing number of Syrians to struggle
          to get enough food to eat," writes the New York Times. The Syrian economy is at its lowest since the beginning
          of the war: the devaluation of the Syrian pound
          against the dollar has reached historic lows, thus further reducing the purchasing power of many Syrians while
          the prices of basic food and of gasoline have undergone a sharp surge (+ 230% in the last year according to
          Unicef). According to the World Food Program , 60% of Syrians , equal to 12.4 million people, are at risk of
          suffering from hunger : the highest number ever recorded.<br>
          <b>The war in Syria today: refugees do not want to return</b><br>During 2020 alone, 1.8 million Syrians left
          their homes, while only 467,000 people returned to their homes: " For every person who returned home, four
          were forced to flee ", it reads in the report The darkest decade published by the Norwegian refugee council (
          here the Pdf). In January 2021 alone, over 23,000 internally displaced people were registered : one in three
          said they had
          left their home due to lack of access to basic services, while 28% did so due to the deterioration of economic
          conditions. With the economy on its knees and the Assad regime's total control of the country, displaced
          Syrians across
          the Middle East say "overwhelmingly" that they have lost hope of being able to return home in the next 5 to 10
          years. . The risk is that the nearly 5.6 million Syrian refugees in neighboring countries will be forced to
          live in a condition of uncertainty for many years to come: with no possibility of return on the one hand and
          no possibility of fully integrating on the other. "The few who expressed a desire to go home said they would
          only do so if there was a political agreement and
          their safety was guaranteed," the report reads. “The longer this crisis remains unresolved, the more we expect
          economic poverty to become the main driver for further travel. Yet more and more countries are turning their
          backs on Syria. They must come out of their indifference to intervene constructively to support the millions
          of Syrians who depend on vital aid and are clamoring for an end to the conflict, ”said Jan Egeland , secretary
          general of the Norwegian refugee council.

        <h2 class="history-title">The War in Syria: 7 Years. 7 Facts. Countless lives.</h2>
        <p class="history-writer">The UN Refugee Agency | 19 March 2018</p>
        <img class="history-image">
        <h3 class="history-subtitle"><span>Article #3</span> THE FACTS</h3>
        <p class="history-article">Seven years of war have torn families apart, destroyed innocent lives and shattered
          dreams. Sadly, a generation of children has known nothing but war.
          Conflict broke out seven years ago this month, and brutality, fear and hunger have been everyday realities for
          millions of Syrians. Millions fled the violence seeking safety in neighboring countries but now face crippling
          poverty. Millions of other Syrians remain trapped inside their besieged country.
          The UN Refugee Agency is observing this grim milestone with renewed determination to save and protect those in
          greatest need. This determination is made possible by caring Americans who refuse to sit on the sidelines
          while people are suffering.
          Here are seven facts about the crisis and seven ways USA for UNHCR donors are helping Syrians:
          <br>
          <b>1. More than half of all Syrians have been forced to flee their homes.</b><br>
          There are more than 5.5 million Syrian refugees and more than 6 million people trapped inside Syria. This
          bleak tally represents over half of the country’s population — and makes Syria the world’s largest
          humanitarian catastrophe.
          In partnership with caring and committed donors, UNHCR provided 2.6 million people with protection and
          community services in 2017, like registering the birth of a child or replacing lost documents.
          <br>
          <b>2. Most Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring countries.</b><br>
          Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt are the five neighboring countries that host the most Syrian refugees.
          Nearly 55 percent live in Turkey alone. Approximately one in four people in Lebanon is a Syrian refugee.
          This winter, generous donors provided more than 24,000 Syrian refugee families living in Jordan with cash
          assistance and supplies to protect their shelters for the coldest months. In Egypt, donors helped provide more
          than 60,000 refugees with access to primary healthcare.
          <br>
          <b>3. Most Syrian refugees live in extreme poverty.</b><br>
          Ninety percent of Syrian refugees live in rural and urban host communities — not camps. In Lebanon, nearly 60
          percent of Syrian refugee families live on less than $3 per person per day.
          Thanks to generous donors, nearly 30,000 Syrian refugee families received cash grants in December 2017 — vital
          cash assistance to purchase food, heating fuel and other necessities.
          <br>
          <b>4. Against all odds, Syrians are survivors.</b><br>
          Despite years of terror and hardship, Syrians continue to demonstrate their courage and resilience. They make
          sacrifices every day to put the needs of their loved ones first. Families turn their temporary shelters into
          homes.They all are working to rebuild their lives with hope and dignity.
          In the first six months of 2017, 1,000 Syrians received small grants to start up new businesses. Nineteen
          thousand individuals enrolled in life skills training to help them prepare for a brighter future.
          <br>
          <b>5. Syrian children are missing out on education.</b><br>
          Inside Syria, one in four schools have been damaged, destroyed or converted into emergency shelters. Less than
          half of elementary-school-aged children are enrolled in school. Even more worrisome: a tiny fraction of middle
          school-, high school- and college-aged students have access to education.
          Offering girls and boys the opportunity to learn gives them a chance at a better future. In Lebanon, donor
          support allowed nearly 40,000 Syrian refugee children to enroll in elementary education by mid-2017.
          <br>
          <b>6. While some Syrians returned home, even more fled in 2017.</b><br>
          In 2017, approximately 655,000 people who had previously been displaced inside Syria returned home. Seventy
          thousand refugees also returned from neighboring countries. Many found their homes destroyed and their
          neighborhoods without power or running water. During the same period, at least 1.8 million Syrians fled their
          homes, and remain trapped by ongoing fighting inside the country in places like Eastern Ghouta.
          In 2017, donors helped reach over 3 million people displaced inside Syria, including those in hard-to-reach
          areas, with blankets, mattresses, sleeping mats, jerry cans, kitchen supplies, plastic sheets, solar lamps and
          other humanitarian aid.
          <br>
          <b>7. Syria’s war has lasted longer than World War II.</b><br>
          As the conflict drags on, so do the struggles of its survivors. More refugees come from Syria than any other
          country. Despite the persisting, immense scale of the crisis, it risks becoming another forgotten emergency.
          "Ultimately, Syria’s conflict isn’t about numbers — it’s about people," Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner
          for Refugees, said. With generous donor support, UNHCR will never forget the people of Syria — and will give
          them hope for more peaceful days ahead.
